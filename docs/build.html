    <h1>Building Guide</h1>

    <p>This chapter covers the building process in more detail,
      describes the available building functions and their parameters.</p>

    <a name="principles">
    <h2>Building Process Principles</h2>

    <p>When the building functions are used you will be dealing with
      two things called <b>buildplan</b> and <b>buildtask</b>.</p>

    <p>A buildplan is like a blueprint of a structure. It defines a
      list of blocks, including their meta values (which define
      subtype and/or orientation for some block types). The block
      coordinates within the buildplan are relative to a block at
      0,0,0 called <b>pivot</b>. The pivot block may be itself
      a part of the buildplan or not - it does not matter. The pivot
      however represents the &quot;origin&quot; of the buildplan</p>

    <p>A buildplan can be created using one of the parametric building
      functions, imported from external files, and manipulated in
      various ways.</p>

    <p>In order to start actual building, you need to start a buildtask
      from the buildplan by placing its pivot somewhere in the world.
      Both position and direction of the placement define how the
      blocks will be placed. The block coordinates are translated from
      the relative to the world coordinates. The orientation-dependent
      meta values are rotated to match the new direction. In the
      buildplan, the metas are encoded as if the pivot direction is
      towards north. When pivot is placed, you define the new direction.</p>

    <p>The actual placement may be done either by specifying explicit
      coordinates and direction as parameter, or more conveniently by
      placing a block. The coordinates and the direction of the placement
      are taken as pivot parameters, and the placement itself is not
      forwarded to the server.</p>

    <p>Some other parameters used in the various commands behave that
      way - you can either specify them explicitly, or omit them, and
      make MCBuild use some defaults derived from your current state.
      One such parameter is the material specification - if you omit it,
      MCBuild will just use the block type you are currently holding.
    </p>

    <p>In order to have a quick example, how it works, try following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hold some buildable block in your hand</li>
      <li>Enter <tt>#build floor 5,5</tt></li>
      <li>You should get a message about created floor</li>
      <li>Place any block at some coordinates</li>
      <li>You will receive another message about placing pivot and the building will start</li>
      <li>Walk around the structure being built to reach all corners</li>
      <li>Enter <tt>#build cancel</tt> to stop building</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/build_example.jpg">

    <p>You may have noticed that if you break the blocks you just
      built without canceling, they will be immediately rebuilt. This is
      because your active buildtask constantly checks if there are
      buildable blocks in vicinity that are unoccupied and will attempt
      to place blocks there.</p>

    <p>In order to be built, blocks need to have adjacent blocks already
      in place. Most full blocks without specific orientation can be placed
      on any of the adjacent surfaces, but certain blocks require a certain
      direction to be placed in order to obtain correct orientation. Ultimately,
      the player must click once of the suitable points at a suitable face
      while facing a suitable direction.</p>

    <p>While a buildtask is active, MCBuild constantly checks which blocks
      fulfill these conditions and can be placed, but it is the task of the
      player to navigate around the structure to reach all possible points</p>

    <p>MCBuild will automatically fetch the necessary materials from your
      inventory into the hotbar slots 3-7 and use them to build. If you're
      building in creative mode, that works as well, but you need to have all
      materials you are using in your survival inventory - creative block
      selection is not supported.</p>

    <a name="parameters">
    <h2>Build Command Parameters</h2>

    <p>Before we can review the various build commands available, we need
      to understand how MCBuild is parsing parameters to its functions.
      The parameter parsing is designed such way that the user will have
      to type as little as possible while avoiding ambiguity. Many option
      names can be shortened or omitted, some parameter parts have default
      values, and as already mentioned, some parameters can be omitted
      altogether, making MCBuild using suitable defaults derived from your
      current gamestate.</p>

    <p>There are two types of parameters - named parameters and flags.</p>

    <p>The flag-type parameters are always preceeded by a minus sign, but
      may have long or short name. They are simple switches, enabling
      some option when specified.</p>

    <p>Named parameters have the general format <tt>name=value</tt>.
      If a command expects a certain named parameter, if will first
      look for the general form, using the full or one of the shortened
      names of the parameter. If not found, a named parameter may have
      a default position, in which case the name can be omitted, and only
      the value used as parameter. If that is not found, or the parameter
      has no default position, it may have a way to be derived from
      the game state. For example, the parameter defining a position of
      the pivot can be obtained when player places a block.</p>

    <p>Named parameters in their full form (i.e. with the name), and flags
      can be specified in any order on the command line. Named parameters
      without a name however must be specified in their default order.</p>

    <p>The values of the named parameter may have many different forms.
      So, for example a material specification can be done by numeric
      block ID, or hexadecimal ID, or even by name. It may also have an
      optional meta value, which can be also numeric or a string.</p>

    <p>The following example illustrates how it works for the command
      <tt>#build stair</tt>. This command creates a flight of stairs,
      it has a mandatory parameter <tt>size</tt> and optional parameter
      the <tt>material</tt>, as well as a few flags. The following
      list shows examples what the user can specify and how MCBuild
      will interpret this.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs size=5,10 material=brick</tt></p>
    <p>This creates a buildplan of stairs, 5 blocks wide, and 10 blocks
      high, made of brick blocks and the default minimal base -
      one column of blocks under the stairs to provide connection
      between the steps).</p>

    <img src="images/stairs1.jpg">

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs m=brick s=5,10</tt></p>
    <p>This will create exactly the same, but the order of the parameters
      is arbitrary (since they both have proper names) and I used
      the short names.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs 5,10 brick</tt></p>
    <p>This is an even shorter form that omits the names and therefore
      the parameters are interpreted in their default order. It is
      assumed that &quot;5,10&quot; is the size parameter, and
      &quot;brick&quot; is the material.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs brick 5,10</tt></p>
    <p>This however will give you an error - the parameters have no names
      so the default order is assumed, and &quot;brick&quot; cannot
      be parsed as size.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs m=brick 5,10</tt></p>
    <p>This however works - the material parameter is identified by the
      explicit name, while the size as the first unnamed parameter</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs brick s=5,10</tt></p>
    <p>This works as well - as long as the ambiguity is resolved
      somehow, argument parsing will identify the necessary parameters.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs -e wooden_stairs -f s=5,10</tt></p>
    <p>Flags can be placed anywhere - since they have a unique name
      and can be identified by the minus sign. This particular command
      will use wooden stairs block, make a full base (i.e. base extends
      over the entire width of the stairs) and make sure exactly same block
      is used for the base (otherwise MCBuild will try to use matching
      wooden planks)</p>

    <img src="images/stairs2.jpg">

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs 5,10</tt></p>
    <p>In this case we don't specify the material. MCBuild will assume
      we want to build using the block we currently hold in our hand.
      If the player holds nothing, or it's an item that cannot be placed
      as a block, you will receive an error.</p>

    <img src="images/stairs3.jpg">
    <p>As you may see - in this case the cobblestone stairs was
      used for building the stairs, since the player held it in hand
      and the cobblestone block was used for the base.</p>

    <a name="commonparam">
    <h2>Common Parameters</h2>

    <p>A reference for some common parameter value formats used in multiple
      commands.</p>

    <a name="par_mat">
    <h3>Material</h3>

    <p>Material can be specified my its decimal or hexadecimal block ID,
      or by symbolic name. For slabs you can also specify whether you
      want the upper or the lower form.</p>

    <p>Names: material,mat,m</p>

    <p>As example, the following material formats represent stone and sandstone
      slabs in different positions. The block ID for stone slabs is 0x2C / 44, but
      block meta is additionally required to define exact material and position.
      By default, meta=0 will be assumed, which corresponds to the plain stone slabs
      in lower position. Sandstone stone slabs have meta 1 for the lower (default)
      and 9 for the upper position. The exact type can be controlled by the explicit
      meta value or in combination of the meta value + upper flag</p>

    <h3>Pivot</h3>

    <p>The pivot parameter defines a specific absolute world coordinates plus
      direction. As the name suggests, it defines the exact placement of a pivot
      block in the world and is thus used with commands lice <tt>place</tt> and

    <a name="build_parametric">
    <h2>Parametric Structures</h2>

    <p>This class of commands will create a buildplan of simple generic structures,
      usually made from a single type of material and with size specified as parameter.</p>

    <p>Calling a parametric build command will replace your current buildplan
      with a generated one, but the current buildtask will be cancelled only upon
      placement. By default, you will immediately enter the "#build place once"
      mode of placement (depending on your placemode setting), i.e. placing
      a block somewhere will specify the pivot point of your new structure
      and the building will start.</p>

    <p>All parametric build commands accept the parameter <a href="#par_mat">material</a>
      in one of the supported formats. If you omit the explicit material specification,
      the material you currently hold in your hand will be used. If your hand is empty
      of you hold a non-placeable item, you will receive an error.</p>

    <a name="para_floor">
    <h3>floor,rect</h3>

    <p>Flat rectangular floor. rect variation takes exactly same parameters but creates only the border.</p>

    <p>Parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>size|sz|s=W[,L] : size of the floor, W blocks wide (to the right) and L blocks long (to the front). If L is omitted, assuming square WxW.</li>

    <p>A flight of stairs with an optional base (to allow building over open space. If you choose a stairs-type block as material,
      the meta values will be adjusted to create correct steps and the base blocks will be created using a matching material
      (i.e. cobblestone blocks for the cobblestone stairs), unless -e option specified.</p>
    <p>Format:</p>
    <p><tt>#build stairs size=W,H [material=matspec] [-n|m|f] [-e]</tt></p>

    <h3>scaffolding,scaf</h3>

    <p>A scaffolding with given width and number of levels build out of blocks of a single type (dirt by default).
      If the -l option specified, an alternative design using ladders will be created. The standard-design
      scaffolding screates a simple stairs allowing you to climb it. The scaffolding is made at least 7 blocks wide.
      The floors are 3 blocks high.</p>

    <p>Format:</p>

    <a name="para_seal">
    <h3>seal</h3>

    <p>This is a special option useful for sealing nether tunnels - a quite
     tedious task. This creates a 1x2x1000 wall of netherack, but it's
     orientation is your back. That means, the wall will extend from the
     origin point towards you. It is intended that you place the pivot
     at the end of the tunnel, looking to the sealed end and then retreat
     backwards from the tunnel to seal it.</p>
    <p>While a buildplan like this can be easily created with other commands,
     placing a seal automatically enters so called "seal mode" that will make
     sure all blocks at one position in the tunnel are placed before
     progressing. This ensures that there are no empty blocks left accidentally.
    </p>

    <p>Format:</p>
    <p><tt>#build seal</tt></p>

    <p>Parameters:</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>

    <p>Examples and usage tips:</p>

    <p><tt>#build seal</tt> 1x2x1000 wall of neterrack</p>



    <a name="build_manipulate">
    <h2>Buildplan Manipulation</h2>

    <p>This section describes functions that perform various manipulations
      on the buildplan. The functions require an existing and non-empty
      buildplan. They will modify the buildplan only and not your current
      buildtask.</p>


    <a name="mani_ext">
    <h3>extend,ext</h3>

    <p>Extend the buildplan by replicating it a number of times and
      placing the copies at an offset. The offset may be specified explicitly,
      or by specifying the extension direction, in which case the copies will
      be placed next to each other or stacked. If any blocks of a copy overlap the
      previously existing blocks they will replace these.</p>

    <p>Format:</p>
    <p><tt>#build extend offset=x[,z[,y]]|dir [count=n]</tt></p>

    <h2>Special Functions</h2>


    <a name="spec_recorder">
    <h3>record,rec</h3>

    <p>Recorder allows you to create a buildplan on the fly by recording
      your own block placements. The recording is started by issuing
      <tt>#build record start</tt> (or just <tt>#build record</tt>) command.
      The first block you place automatically becomes your pivot block.</p>
    <p>Recording is stopped with <tt>#build record stop</tt>, after which you
      will have a valid buildplan.</p>
    <p>Recording can be resumed with <tt>#build record resume</tt></p>

    <a name="spec_scan">
    <h3>scan</h3>

    <p>Scan function creates a buildplan from the existing world
      structure. The scan cuboid is specified by the pivot location
      and size. The pivot is always in normalized position, meaning
      your scanning ares will extend to the right, front and upwards
      from it. Scanning will automatically omit certain blocks such
      as water, lava, fire, and grass.</p>

    <p>Format:</p>
    <p><tt>#build scan pivot=pivotspec size=width[,length[,height]]</tt></p>

    <p>Parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>pivot|pv|p - <a href="#par_pivot">Pivot specification</a></li>
      <li>size|sz|s - Size of the cuboid to scan. If height or length
        is omitted, they are assumed 1.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Examples and usage tips:</p>
    <p><tt>#build scan 1 15,9,10</tt></p>
    <p>Most convenient way to specify the pivot is by using the
      &quot;distance&quot; form of the pivot specification. Use 0
      while standing directly on the spot of the pivot point, or
      1 while standing right before it, as pictured below.
      (The redstone block marks the position below the pivot)</p>
    <img src="images/scan_pos.jpg">
    <p>Make sure to select your pivot point to get the blocks on

    <a name="spec_mat">
    <h3>material,mat</h3>

    <p>Prints a summary of required materials to the standard output.
      By default, takes into account which blocks are already placed and
      calculates the necessary remaining amount. With -p option, you
      can print the total amount of materials required by the buildplan.
      When the amount of a material exceeds its stack size, the number of
      stacks is printed instead, using dollar sign to denote that.
    </p>

    <p>Format:</p>
    <p><tt>#build material [-p]</tt></p>

    <p>Parameters:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <a name="build_control">
    <h2>Building Control</h2>

    <a name="ctrl_place">
    <h3>place</h3>

    <p>Place a pivot block in the world to create a buildtask from the buildplan
      and initiate building process. The pivot coordinates can be specified
      explicitly, in which case the building can start immediately, or let
      the player place any block at the desired pivot coordinates.</p>

    <p>Note that most commands for parametric builds or buildplan manipulation
      or loading will automatically initiate placement mode, as if you type
      <tt>#build place once</tt> immediately afterward. This behavior can be
      changed by setting the <a href="#build_opts">placemode</a> option.</p>

    <p>Format:</p>
    <p><tt>#build place once</tt> - initiate placement process. When player places
      any block, its position and player's look direction will define the pivot.</p>
    <p><tt>#build place many</tt> - initiate placement process, but unlike
      &quot;place once&quot; placement mode is retained when player places a block,
      every time adding another copy of buildplan to the buildtask, until canceled</p>
    <p><tt>#build place again</tt> - place the buildplan once more at the same coordinates</p>
    <p><tt>#build place cancel</tt> - cancel the placement process. Not to be confused
      with <tt>#build cancel</tt> which cancels building process</p>
    <p><tt>#build pivot=pivotspec</tt> - place the buildplan at explicitly specified pivot.</p>

    <p>Parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>pivot|pv|p - <a href="#par_pivot">Pivot specification</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Examples and usage tips:</p>
    <p><tt>#build place</tt> - start placement process.</p>
    <p><tt>#build place 100,200,64,n</tt> - place at coordinates x=100, z=200, y=64, in direction North</p>
    <p><tt>#build place 1</tt> - place right before the player and in the direction of player's look</p>



    <a name="ctrl_cancel">
    <h3>cancel</h3>

    <p>Cancel the building process. This command will stop and clear your buildtask
      and any active placement mode, but your buildplan will remain. After canceling,
      you can restart building process at the same position with <tt>#build place again</tt>.
      Issuing any command that creates, loads or modifies your buildplan will also
      cancel your current buildtask.</p>

    <p>Format:</p>
    <p><tt>#build cancel</tt></p>


    <a name="ctrl_pause">
    <h3>pause</h3>

    <p>Pauses or unpauses the building process without canceling the buildtask.
      This command is useful when you need to interrupt building briefly to
      fix something manually or to avoid dangerous situation. It is very advisable
      to bind this command to a hotkey, if your client supports that.</p>

    <p>Format:</p>
    <p><tt>#build pause</tt></p>


    <a name="ctrl_preview">
    <h3>preview</h3>

    <p>Create an in-world preview of your current buildtask. The preview is generated
      by spawning phanthom blocks in your world (using BlockChange packets injected
      into protocol). Please note that the blocks only exist in your client and
      not on the server, however are assumed to be real by your client. Attempting
      to walk over them, or standing in the spot where such blocks may appear may
      be dangerous in survival mode, as you may fall through or be pushed aside.</p>

    <p>The preview has two modes - the &quot;true&quot; mode and the &quot;missing&quot;
      mode. The former will display how the build would like when finished. The latter
      will show you the positions of the blocks missing or incorrectly placed, using
      a single type of block. Currently, the sugarcane block is used for this purpose
      for its properties - it is considered non-solid by the client, so it won't block
      your movement and at the same time allowing you to use safewalk mods to avoid
      accidentally stepping on it.</p>

    <p>Currently the preview had several deficiencies that will be addressed in the
      future releases.</p>

    <p>Large previews can cause generation of many block updates at once, which may
      stall your client and cause it to timeout and disconnect. Avoid using it on
      builds with more than 10000 blocks or try to limit the preview size by using
      <a href="#ctrl_limit">limit</a> or <a href="#mani_trim">trim</a>.</p>

    <p>If you cancel your buildtask while a preview is still active, by default
      it is automatically removed. You can override this behavior with the build
      option <a href="#build_opts">preview_retain</a>.</p>

    <p>The phantom blocks may disappear because of the block updates in adjacent
      blocks, or because of the build attempts not accepted by the server.
      you can issue a preview command again to renew them.</p>

    <p>It is advisable to bind the preview commands to hotkeys, if supported by
      your client.</p>

    <p>Format:</p>
    <p><tt>#build preview [-t|-m|-r]</tt></p>

    <p>Parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>-true|t - Activate &quot;true&quot; preview mode.</li>
      <li>-missing|m - Activate &quot;missing&quot; preview mode.</li>
      <li>-remove|r - Remove the preview.</li>
    </ul>


    <a name="ctrl_limit">
    <h3>limit,li</h3>

    <p>Limit the maximum height level for building. This function is meant
      to allow you to build layer by layer, which is often the only reliable
      method for building large structures in survival, where you don't have
      ability to fly and have to use your bulding as platform for walking on.</p>

    <p>Setting the limit does not trim your buildtask, it only disables building
      of the blocks above defined limit. The idea is to set limit one higher
      every time you finish a layer and so gradually advance to the top.</p>

    <p>Setting the limit affects the preview function - the preview will
      be trimmed to the same height.</p>

    <p>Format:</p>
    <p><tt>#build limit Y</tt> - set limit to specific Y coordinate. Only blocks
      with y&lt;=Y can be build</p>
    <p><tt>#build limit</tt> - set limit to the coordinate of player's feet. By issuing
      this command you will enable the building of the layer just above the block you
      are standing on</p>
    <p><tt>#build limit -|none</tt> - disable limit.</p>



    <a name="build_vars">
    <h2>Options and Variables</h2>

    <p>Some of parameters in the building process can be controlled by the
      user through a set of variables.</p>

    <p>The intervals for the block placements are chosen to provide a reasonable
      placement rate on a laggy server. If your server has a good performance
      and does not limit block placement with Anticheat (e.g. running creative
      mode) you can lower the interval values (blkint, bldint) to get building
      faster. Beware however that a low blkint may lead to problems when placing
      slabs, as you may accidentally place double-slabs.</p>

    <p>The bjump option is important to know. It was introduced to prevent annoying
      situations where you jump or fall down, but an attempt by MCBuild to place
      block that comes in range causes you to teleport back, potentially creating
      a dangerous situation. In one particular case, this caught me in a "loop of
      death" once - I fell down from 10-15 blocks height, which itself did not cause
      a major damage. But by a chance there was a vacant block near the ground that
      MCBuild attempted to place. I took fall damage, block placement was not accepted
      by the server and I was teleported back to the top, fell again, ... and ended
      up dead after a couple loops.</p>

    <p>However, bjump=0 also blocks building when flying or swimming, since the player
      in not OnGround in these situations. In order to be able to build in water or
      while flying on creative, you need to set <tt>#build opt bjump 1</tt> .</p>
